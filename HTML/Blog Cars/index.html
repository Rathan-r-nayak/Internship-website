                    Jaguar XF price for the base model starts at Rs. 71.60 Lakh and the top model price goes upto Rs. 76.00 Lakh (Avg. ex-showroom). XF price for 2 variants is listed below.
                    Jaguar XF price ranges between Rs. 71.60 Lakh - Rs. 76.00 Lakh depending on the variant selected.

                    The Jaguar XF, when introduced, opened up the gates into Jaguar’s world of cars. Now with the XE holding that mantle, the XF has grown bigger and you can say, better. The new 2016 Jaguar XF, though on the same platform, is longer and lighter than its predecessor and comes with new equipment.

                    For the first time in any Jaguar, the headlights feature adaptive full-LED technology. They also feature the brand’s signature J-Blade LED daytime running lights, as seen in the outgoing model. As for the size, the new XF is 4,954mm long and at 2,960mm, the wheelbase is 51mm longer than before. Though 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than the original XF, Jaguar says its new model is more spacious than the previous. On the outside, the near vertical fascia, shorter front overhang, longer wheelbase and the aggressive looking front and rear taillights reflect Jaguar’s new approach towards designing their cars.

                    Jaguar F-Type price for the base model starts at Rs. 99.96 Lakh and the top model price goes upto Rs. 1.53 Crore (Avg. ex-showroom). F-Type price for 3 variants is listed below.
                    The Jaguar F-Type has a sensual design with sleek lines and a coupe silhouette. It comes with multiple engine options and trim levels, so there’s an F-Type for everyone. Plus, the 5.0-litre V8 offers blistering performance.It is offered in three variants – 2.0-litre coupe R-Dynamic, 5.0-litre V8 coupe R-Dynamic, and 5.0-litre V8 convertible R-Dynamic.
                    The F-Type loses the feline design penned by Ian Callum for a more generic ‘always angry’ design philosophy. The sleek headlamps, new grille, massive air intakes and air vents on the engine cover are part of the new design theme being adopted by all new Jaguar cars. Apart from some new upholstery and trim materials, the interior design has been left untouched.
